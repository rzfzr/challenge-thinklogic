# challenge-thinklogic

Some notes:
- I used node v20
- It is definitely not pixel perfect, I would need an extra hour for that.
- Only half way through I realised that I could get tailwind directly from figma, so I used that instead, as result there are plenty of duplicated classes and extractables components.
- I tried to make the scrollbar button from scratch but it is in its very initial state.
- Some spaces on the figma project are in font-sizes, but did not match the REM scaling very well, that would be something I would question the designer about.
- I assumed the given screen sizes as breakpoints, the larger one could scale but I chose not too.
